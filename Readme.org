* Title
  ssh configuration parser
* Motivation
  We usually have list of servers in a ssh configuration but have hard time to use that information other than doing ~ssh~. Wanted to make that information more generic and usable by parsing and converting
the ~.ssh/config~
* Current Workflow
  - converting the document into parsable(not sure if this word exists) form
    - removing space, extra lines, comments
  - parsing the parsable file
  - echoing the parsed information into a simple and usable format
